class SimpleLauncher(threading.Thread):
    """Simple profiling launcher.

The `SimpleLauncher` is top-level class to do statistical
profiling. While some features are configurable, the simplest thing to
do is just instantiate an instance of this class and call its
`unpause` method to start profiling.

Basically, what this class does is:

  1. Creates an instance of the `Sampler` class with reasonable defaults.
  2. Initializes itself as a daemon thread and starts.
  3. Pauses itself so the thread does nothing so as to not load the system.
  4. Provides an `unpause` method you can use when you want to turn on
     profiling.
  5. Provides a `pause` method if you want to turn off profiling.


Example usage is shown below:

>>> import random, math, time
>>> from ox_profile.core import launchers
>>> launcher = launchers.SimpleLauncher()
>>> def example_func(x):
...     return [math.atanh(random.uniform(0,1)) for i in range(x)]
...
>>> launcher.start()
>>> launcher.unpause()
>>> dummy = [example_func(i) for i in range(2000)]
>>> query, total_records = launcher.sampler.my_db.query()
>>> info = ['%s: %s' % (i.name, i.hits) for i in query]
>>> print('Items:%s' % (('%c - ' % 10).join([''] + info)))# doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Items:
 - ...
 - ...
>>> launcher.cancel()  # This turns off the profiler for good
